# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application that enables authenticated users to securely view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS managed services to ensure scalability, security, and global accessibility.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Authentication and Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication process is handled by Amazon Cognito, where the user is verified through a secure login process with multi-factor authentication enabled. Upon successful authentication, the application retrieves an IdToken and AccessToken, which are used to securely call the backend API hosted on Amazon API Gateway. The API Gateway, protected by AWS WAF, routes the request to AWS Lambda functions, which interact with Amazon DynamoDB to fetch and display the user's transaction data on the dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to a Lambda function. This function processes the transaction and writes the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. DynamoDB Streams trigger another Lambda worker function that normalizes the transaction data and writes aggregated information to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 for financial reporting purposes. This flow ensures real-time processing and storage of transaction data, maintaining high availability and scalability.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request a monthly financial report through the dashboard. This request is processed by the API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function to initiate an AWS Step Functions workflow. The workflow orchestrates multiple steps to aggregate data from Amazon Aurora, ensuring that the report is comprehensive and accurate. The final report is securely stored in an Amazon S3 private bucket, encrypted with AES-256, and made available for the user to download. This flow provides users with timely and secure access to their financial reports, supporting informed decision-making.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS, which acts as a decoupling mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. A dedicated Lambda worker function processes these events, normalizing the data and writing it to both DynamoDB and Aurora. This ensures that all incoming data is consistently processed and stored, supporting the system's data integrity and availability.

5. **Observability and Monitoring**: The system's observability is enhanced through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray provides request tracing, allowing for detailed analysis of system performance and identification of bottlenecks. This comprehensive monitoring setup ensures that the system remains reliable and any issues are promptly addressed.

6. **Security and Compliance**: The system employs robust security controls, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, IAM roles with least privilege access, and no public S3 buckets. AWS Secrets Manager manages database passwords and API secrets, ensuring that sensitive information is securely stored and accessed.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application deployed on AWS, designed to enable authenticated users to securely view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, thereby enhancing financial management and operational efficiency for businesses.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Login & Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication process is handled by Amazon Cognito, where the user is verified and provided with an IdToken and AccessToken. These tokens are used by the application to securely call the backend API through Amazon API Gateway, which then triggers AWS Lambda functions to interact with Amazon DynamoDB, retrieving and displaying transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and invokes a Lambda function. This function processes the transaction and writes the metadata to Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB Streams then trigger a Lambda worker function that normalizes the data and writes aggregated transaction data to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2. This ensures that transaction data is processed efficiently and stored securely for further analysis.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request financial reports, such as a monthly report, through the application. The request is routed via API Gateway to a Lambda function, which initiates an AWS Step Functions workflow. This workflow orchestrates the aggregation of data from Amazon Aurora, processes it, and stores the final report in a private Amazon S3 bucket. This flow ensures that financial reports are generated accurately and securely, maintaining data confidentiality and integrity.

4. **Data Ingestion & Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS, which queues the events for processing. A dedicated AWS Lambda worker function retrieves these events, normalizes them, and writes the processed data to both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora. This flow ensures that data ingestion is handled efficiently, supporting real-time processing and storage.

5. **Observability & Monitoring**: The system's observability is managed through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray provides request tracing, enabling detailed analysis of system performance and troubleshooting. This flow ensures that the system is monitored effectively, allowing for quick detection and resolution of issues.

6. **Security Controls & Data Protection**: The application employs multiple security controls, including encryption of S3 buckets, DynamoDB, and Aurora data using KMS-managed keys, and enforcing TLS 1.2 for data in transit. IAM roles are configured with least privilege, and no public S3 buckets are allowed. This flow ensures that data is protected against unauthorized access and potential breaches, maintaining compliance with data protection standards.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application that enables authenticated users to securely view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS managed services to ensure scalability, security, and global accessibility.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Authentication and Dashboard Access**: The user authentication process is initiated when a user opens the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito, which ensures secure user login with MFA enabled. Once authenticated, the application obtains an IdToken and AccessToken, allowing the user to access the dashboard. The app then calls the API Gateway, which routes the request to AWS Lambda functions. These functions interact with Amazon DynamoDB to retrieve and display transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and triggers an AWS Lambda function. This function writes the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB Streams then trigger a Lambda worker, which processes the transaction data further. The worker normalizes the data and writes aggregated information to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, ensuring that financial reporting data is up-to-date and securely stored.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request financial reports, such as a monthly report, through the application. This request is processed by the API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function. The function initiates an AWS Step Functions workflow that aggregates the necessary data from Amazon Aurora. Once the data is aggregated, the final report is securely stored in an Amazon S3 private bucket, ensuring that only authorized users can access the highly confidential financial reports.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS. AWS Lambda workers then process these events, normalizing the data and writing it to both Amazon DynamoDB and Aurora. This ensures that all transaction and reporting data is consistently updated and available for analysis.

5. **Observability and Monitoring**: The system's observability is enhanced through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray provides request tracing, allowing for detailed analysis of system performance and potential bottlenecks.

6. **Security and Compliance**: The system employs multiple security controls, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, IAM roles with least privilege, and AWS WAF rules to protect against common web vulnerabilities. Data classification ensures that PCI-related transaction metadata, user profile information, and financial reports are handled according to their confidentiality requirements, mitigating business risks such as unauthorized access and data leakage.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application designed to empower authenticated users by providing secure access to view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS's managed services to ensure scalability, security, and global accessibility.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Authentication and Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication process is managed by Amazon Cognito, where users are verified using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. Upon successful authentication, the application retrieves an IdToken and AccessToken, which are used to securely call the backend API through Amazon API Gateway. The API Gateway, protected by AWS WAF, routes the request to AWS Lambda functions that interact with Amazon DynamoDB to fetch and display transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to a Lambda function. This function processes the transaction and writes the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through KMS-managed encryption. DynamoDB Streams trigger a Lambda worker function that normalizes the transaction data and writes aggregated information to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2. This process ensures that transaction data is efficiently processed and stored for further analysis and reporting.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request financial reports, such as a monthly report, through the application interface. The request is handled by the API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function to initiate a multi-step workflow managed by AWS Step Functions. Step Functions orchestrate the aggregation of data from Amazon Aurora, ensuring that the report generation process is efficient and reliable. The final report is securely stored in an Amazon S3 private bucket, encrypted with AES-256, and accessible only to authorized users, maintaining the confidentiality of highly sensitive financial data.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS, which acts as a decoupling mechanism to ensure reliable message delivery. AWS Lambda worker functions process these events, normalizing and writing the data to both DynamoDB and Aurora. This ensures that the data pipeline is robust and capable of handling high volumes of transactions without data loss or integrity issues.

5. **Observability and Monitoring**: The system's observability is enhanced through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray provides request tracing, allowing for detailed analysis of system performance and identification of potential bottlenecks or security issues. This comprehensive monitoring setup ensures that the system remains reliable and secure, with quick detection and response to any anomalies.

6. **Security Controls and Data Protection**: The system employs stringent security controls, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, IAM roles with least privilege access, and no wildcard actions. Public S3 buckets are avoided to prevent unauthorized data access. These measures, combined with VPC endpoints for secure communication with DynamoDB, S3, and Secrets Manager, ensure that sensitive data is protected against unauthorized access and potential breaches.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application deployed on AWS that enables authenticated users to securely view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, enhancing financial management and operational efficiency for businesses.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Authentication and Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication process is handled by Amazon Cognito, where the user is verified through multi-factor authentication (MFA) using SMS or TOTP. Upon successful authentication, the application retrieves an IdToken and AccessToken, enabling secure API calls. The API Gateway, protected by AWS WAF, routes requests to AWS Lambda functions, which interact with Amazon DynamoDB to fetch and display transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to a Lambda function. This function writes the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB, ensuring data is encrypted using KMS-managed keys. DynamoDB Streams trigger a Lambda worker that processes the transaction data, normalizing it and writing aggregated data to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2. This ensures that financial data is securely stored and available for reporting.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request monthly financial reports through the application. The request is processed by the API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function to initiate an AWS Step Functions workflow. This workflow aggregates data from Amazon Aurora, ensuring that the data is encrypted and securely managed. The final report is stored in a private Amazon S3 bucket, encrypted with AES-256, and accessible only to authorized users.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS, which triggers a Lambda worker to normalize incoming events. The worker writes the processed data to both DynamoDB and Aurora, ensuring that the data pipeline is secure and efficient. AWS Step Functions manage multi-step workflows for complex data processing tasks, ensuring data integrity and availability.

5. **Observability and Monitoring**: The system's observability is enhanced through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray provides request tracing, allowing for detailed analysis of system performance and potential bottlenecks. This ensures that any issues are quickly identified and resolved, maintaining system reliability and security.

6. **Networking and Security Controls**: The application is deployed within a VPC, with private subnets for Aurora and Lambdas, and public subnets for the NAT gateway. VPC Endpoints are used for secure access to DynamoDB, S3, and Secrets Manager. Security controls include encryption for all data at rest and in transit, IAM roles with least privilege, and no public S3 buckets, ensuring that the system is secure against unauthorized access and data breaches.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application designed to empower authenticated users by providing secure access to view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS's managed services for enhanced performance and security.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Authentication and Dashboard Access**: The user authentication process is initiated when a user opens the client application, which is served via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito, where the user is verified using multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled through SMS or TOTP. Upon successful authentication, the application obtains an IdToken and AccessToken. These tokens are then used to call the Amazon API Gateway, which routes the request to AWS Lambda functions. The Lambda functions interact with Amazon DynamoDB to retrieve and display user-specific transaction data on the dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the request is sent through the Amazon API Gateway, which validates the request using Cognito JWT validation. The request is then processed by AWS Lambda functions, which write the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB Streams trigger a Lambda worker that processes the transaction data and writes aggregated data to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 for financial reporting purposes.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request a monthly financial report through the application. This request is processed by the Amazon API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function. The Lambda function triggers AWS Step Functions to manage the multi-step workflow required to aggregate data from Amazon Aurora. Once the data is aggregated, the final report is stored in an Amazon S3 private bucket, ensuring secure access and storage.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS. AWS Lambda functions act as workers to normalize these incoming events. The normalized data is then written to both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora, ensuring that transaction metadata and financial reporting data are up-to-date and accurate.

5. **Observability and Monitoring**: The system's observability is managed through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Alarms, which monitor for Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx errors. AWS X-Ray is used for request tracing, providing insights into the performance and health of the application.

6. **Security and Compliance**: The application enforces security controls such as encryption of S3 buckets, DynamoDB, and Aurora using KMS-managed keys. TLS 1.2 is enforced for secure data transmission. IAM roles are configured with least privilege access, and no wildcard actions are allowed. Public S3 buckets are prohibited to prevent unauthorized data access.

7. **Networking and Infrastructure**: The application is deployed within a VPC, with private subnets for Aurora and Lambda functions, and public subnets for the NAT gateway. VPC Endpoints are configured for DynamoDB, S3, and Secrets Manager to ensure secure and efficient access to AWS services.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application designed to empower authenticated users by providing secure access to view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS's managed services for enhanced performance and security.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Login & Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served globally via Amazon CloudFront. The authentication process is managed by Amazon Cognito, where users are authenticated using MFA (SMS or TOTP). Upon successful authentication, the application obtains an IdToken and AccessToken. These tokens are then used to call the Amazon API Gateway, which routes the request to AWS Lambda functions. The Lambda functions interact with Amazon DynamoDB to retrieve and display transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the request is sent through the Amazon API Gateway to an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda function processes the transaction and writes the transaction metadata to Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB Streams then trigger a Lambda worker function, which normalizes the incoming event data. The worker function writes the aggregated data to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 for further financial reporting and analysis.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request a "monthly report" through the application. This request is processed by the Amazon API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function. The Lambda function initiates an AWS Step Functions workflow to manage the multi-step reporting process. Step Functions aggregate the necessary data from Amazon Aurora and store the final report in an Amazon S3 private bucket, ensuring the data is encrypted and securely stored.

4. **Data Ingestion & Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are received by Amazon SQS. AWS Lambda worker functions process these events by normalizing the data and writing it to both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora. This ensures that transaction metadata and financial reporting data are consistently updated and available for analysis.

5. **Observability & Monitoring**: The system's observability is enhanced through Amazon CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Alarms, which monitor Lambda errors and API Gateway 5xx responses. AWS X-Ray is used for request tracing, providing insights into the system's performance and helping to identify potential bottlenecks or issues.

6. **Security Controls & Data Protection**: The system employs various security controls, including encryption of S3 buckets, DynamoDB, and Aurora using KMS-managed keys. IAM roles are configured with the principle of least privilege, and no wildcard actions are allowed. Public S3 buckets are prohibited to prevent unauthorized data access. TLS 1.2 is enforced for secure data transmission.

7. **Networking & Infrastructure**: The application is deployed within a VPC, with private subnets for Aurora and Lambda functions, and public subnets for the NAT gateway. VPC Endpoints are used for DynamoDB, S3, and Secrets Manager to ensure secure and efficient access to these services.

# Introduction

The FinTech Payments Dashboard is a serverless web application designed to empower authenticated users by providing a secure platform to view transactions, reconcile payments, and generate financial reports, leveraging AWS's managed services for enhanced performance and security.

# Functional Flows

1. **User Login & Dashboard Access**: The user initiates access to the FinTech Payments Dashboard by opening the client application, which is served through Amazon CloudFront. Authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito, where the user is verified and provided with IdToken and AccessToken. These tokens are used by the application to securely call the backend API via Amazon API Gateway, which then triggers AWS Lambda functions to interact with Amazon DynamoDB, retrieving and displaying transaction metadata on the user's dashboard.

2. **Transaction Processing**: When a transaction is initiated, the API Gateway receives the request and invokes a Lambda function. This function processes the transaction and writes the relevant metadata to Amazon DynamoDB. DynamoDB Streams then trigger a Lambda worker function, which processes the stream data and writes aggregated transaction data to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 for further financial reporting and analysis.

3. **Financial Report Generation**: Users can request a monthly financial report through the application. This request is processed by the API Gateway, which invokes a Lambda function to start an AWS Step Functions workflow. The workflow aggregates necessary data from Amazon Aurora and processes it to generate the report. The final report is securely stored in an Amazon S3 private bucket, ensuring that only authorized users can access it.

4. **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Event notifications from the backend are sent to Amazon SQS, which queues the events for processing. An AWS Lambda worker function retrieves these events, normalizes the data, and writes it to both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon Aurora, ensuring that all transaction and reporting data is up-to-date and consistent across the system.

5. **Security and Observability**: The system is protected by AWS WAF, which applies OWASP rules and IP reputation filters to safeguard against common web threats. Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Alarms monitor the system for errors and anomalies, while AWS X-Ray provides request tracing to help diagnose and resolve issues quickly. IAM roles are configured with the principle of least privilege to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

6. **Networking and Data Security**: The application operates within a VPC, with private subnets for Aurora and Lambda functions, and public subnets for the NAT gateway. VPC Endpoints are used for secure access to DynamoDB, S3, and Secrets Manager. All data is encrypted using KMS-managed keys, and TLS 1.2 is enforced for secure data transmission. IAM policies are carefully managed to avoid misconfigurations and ensure that no S3 buckets are publicly accessible.
